    A/B Testing of cacti website
  </h1>
  <p class="small_header">Here I'll be running a simple A/B test on this basic cacti selling website. I will be testing for Time to Completion and the return rate.</p>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div id="image-container">
      <p class="image-header">A Version</p>
      <img class="cactus-image" src="images/A.png">
      <p class="image-caption">In this version, the cart is positioned horizontally on the right side.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="image-container">
      <p class="image-header">B Version</p>
      <img class="cactus-image" src="images/B.png">
      <p class="image-caption">In this version, the cart is positioned towards the bottom of the screen below the images.</p>

    Hypothesis
  </h1>
  <div class = "flex-container">
    <div class = "text-container">
      <p class = "image-header">Null Hypothesis</p>
      <p class = "text">Changing the position of the cart in this manner will have no effect on the Time to Completion and the return rate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "text-container">
      <p class = "image-header">Alternate Hypothesis</p>
      <p class = "text">Changing the position of the cart in this manner will have a positive effect on the Time to Completion and will have a different return rate.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="small_header">
    The reasoning behind this alternate hypothesis is that the cart is in an easier to notice place.
    I believe that users will not completely follow the horizontal model, and instead jump around to different
    images. Because of this, having the cart in a more central location will make finding it faster, reducing the
    time to completion. In addition, putting the cart in this location may give off a feeling of being more "final",
    which would reduce the return rate.

    Gathering Tests
  </h1>
  <p class="text">
    This test was given to college students at Brown University, where each user was given either the A version or B version.
    Data was then collected about how quickly they completed the page, and if they returned to the shopping page after
    viewing the cart.

    Results

  <div class = "flex-container">

  <h1 class="header">
    Conclusion
  </h1>
  <p class="text">The average Time to Completion was actually lower in version A than in version B which is the opposite of my alternate hypothesis. However, given how both of these tests resulted in insignificant statistics, it is impossible to know whether the results
    will repeat themselves in another scenario.

    Takeaways
  </h1>
  <ul style="font-size: 18pt">
    <li>A/B tests need to be statistically significant in order to make conclusive changes</li>
    <li>Assumptions about people's behaviour area just assumptions and could very well be wrong</li>
  </ul>
