    Resdesigning the Zumix Website
  </h1>
  <p class="text">Here I'll be taking a look at the about page of the Boston non-profit organization Zumix and
    redesigning it.

  <h2 class="header">The Original Webpage</h2>

  <p class="text">Taking a look at this UI. There are a couple of glaring issues wtih regards to usability,
    learnability, memorability, and accessibility. The original webpage can be found <a
      href="https://www.zumix.org/about">here.</a></p>

  <h2 class="header">Issues</h2>

        Usability
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unfortunately, while this webpage is responsive, when the screen size is changed, buttons and text become
          extremely small for smaller screens. This makes the webpage nearly unusable.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition, the social icons towards the bottom of the page are extremely small even on a larger screen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>
        Learnability
        <ul>
          <li>
            Since the "All About Us" header is the same color as the buttons, it implies that it can be clicked. However
            in reality it is just a header.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>
        Memorability
        <ul>
          <li>
            The bright yellow colors are fairly striking and memorable. With how jarring the color is with the rest of
            the page it makes it easy to remember their function after a long period of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, one issue is that there is some a secondary navbar above the primary navbar. Since the text is
            smaller and not highlighted, it makes it difficult to remember that that is where some of the important
            links are. One does not expect a secondary navbar above the primary one.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        Accessibility
        <ul>
          <li>
            When running WebAIM WAVE on this webpage. It highlights multiple areas where the text has low contrast with
            the background which makes it harder to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a screenreader is used to read through the webpage, it goes through the first few headings in the nav
            bar, but then proceeds to the body of the text. Typically, one would expect it to go through all of the
            headings first, rather than jumping around.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition, since the website is not responsive and does not utilize all of the screen space, the text can
            be small to read.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="text">Next, I'll address how I went about fixing these problems.</p>

  <h2 class="header">Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>

  <p class="text">Fixing most of these issues is a matter of making the page properly responsive, and changing minor
    layout and color changes. </p>

  <p class="text">For layout changes, here are the diagrams of my low-fidelity prototypes:</p>

  <h2 class="header">Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p class="text">This webpage I designed is much more responsive than the original webpage, and all of the content is
    visible regardless of screen size. When viewing my website through WebAIM WAVE there are still a couple of low
    contrast issues. However, I think it is still much more readable than the original webpage. When using a
    screenreader, it goes in a logical order. Starting from the top and going down.</p>
